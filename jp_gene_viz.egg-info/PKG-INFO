        # Installation
        
        The installation requires the Python module `jp_gene_viz` to be installed with its
        dependencies and for the wigdets extension to be enabled in Jupyter/IPython.
        
        For example the following sequence completes a first time complete installation
        
        ### install prerequisites
        
        You will need Python 2.7 and some other libraries for the installation
        to succeed.  I recommend installing 
        [Anaconda for python 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to get all
        needed prerequisite dependencies.
        
        On Debian Linux without using Anaconda I needed to add the following system
        libraries
        
        ```
        sudo apt-get install python-pip
        sudo apt-get install python-dev
        sudo apt-get install -y libigraph0-dev 
        sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
        sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
        sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran
        ```
        
        ### clone the repository and change directory into the repository folder
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz.git
        cd jp_gene_viz
        ```
        
        ### install the requirements and the module
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### enable the widgets extension (just in case it isn't already enabled)
        ```
        jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
        ```
        
        Note: We are upgrading the repository to work with the latest ipywidgets and iPython
        releases.  If you have problems installing the package please post an issue at
        [https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz).
